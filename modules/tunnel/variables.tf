    Cloudflare Tunnels: outbound-only connectors that publish origins on a
    private network without opening an inbound port.

      - name              : the tunnel's identity here and in Cloudflare, matched
                            lower-cased and trimmed. Renaming destroys and
                            recreates the tunnel, which issues a new ID and token
                            and disconnects every connector running the old one.
      - config_src        : "cloudflare" (default) - remotely managed, and the
                            ingress rules below are pushed to every connector - or
                            "local", where the connector reads config.yml on its
                            own host and `ingress` must be empty. Changing it
                            replaces the tunnel.
      - catch_all_service : what a request matching no rule gets. Appended as the
                            final rule, which cloudflared requires. Defaults to
                            "http_status:404".
      - origin_request    : tunnel-wide connection settings between cloudflared
                            and the origin. A rule's own origin_request overrides
                            it. `access` makes cloudflared validate the Access JWT
                            itself: `team_name` is the Zero Trust team, `aud_tags`
                            the Access applications allowed through, and `required`
                            (default true) refuses any request without one.
                            `match_sni_to_host` is the provider's
                            `match_sn_ito_host`, renamed here to what it does.
                            Timeouts are in seconds.
      - ingress           : public hostnames, in evaluation order - the first rule
                            that matches decides. Each rule is:
                              hostname       - the public hostname. A leading "*."
                                               publishes every subdomain.
                              path           - (optional) a regular expression the
                                               request path must match.
                              service        - http://, https://, tcp://, ssh://,
                                               rdp://, smb://, unix://, unix+tls://,
                                               or http_status:<code>.
                              zone_id        - (optional) the zone to create the
                                               hostname's proxied CNAME in. Leave it
                                               unset for a hostname whose DNS is
                                               managed elsewhere.
                              origin_request - (optional) as above, for this rule.

    No tunnel secret is sent. Cloudflare generates one and never returns it, so
    Terraform state holds nothing that can run a connector. Fetch the token when
    installing a connector: dashboard, `cloudflared tunnel token <id>`, or
    GET /accounts/<account_id>/cfd_tunnel/<tunnel_id>/token.
