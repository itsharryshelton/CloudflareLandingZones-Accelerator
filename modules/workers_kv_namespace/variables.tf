    Cloudflare identifies a namespace by an opaque ID rather than by this string,

    which is exactly how an account ends up with three "redirects" nobody can tell
    apart - include the environment or the brand in the name.

    Key/value pairs Terraform owns, keyed by the KV key name. Every pair becomes
    one resource in state, and removing an entry deletes the key from Cloudflare.

      - value   : the stored bytes, as a string. Binary belongs elsewhere; write
                  base64 yourself if you must, and have the Worker decode it.
      - metadata: optional JSON string stored alongside the value and returned by
                  `getWithMetadata()` without a second read.

    This is for small, configuration-shaped data - a feature flag map, a handful
    of routing overrides, a maintenance switch - where the value belongs in the
    configuration next to the Worker that reads it.

    It is NOT how a bulk dataset gets loaded. Terraform issues one API call per
    key, keeps every value in state, and re-plans all of them on every run, so a
    redirect table of tens of thousands of rows takes hours and produces a state
    file nobody can review. `max_managed_pairs` exists to stop that arriving by
    accident; see its description for what to do instead.

    SECURITY: values are stored in Terraform state in plain text and appear in
    plan output. Nothing secret goes in here - a Worker reads secrets from a
    `secrets_store_secret` binding, not from KV.

    Ceiling on how many `pairs` this module will manage, asserted before anything
    is created.

    The limit is about Terraform rather than about KV: KV itself is happy with
    billions of keys, but each one managed here is a resource in state, a line in
    every plan and a separate API call on every apply. A few hundred is
    configuration; tens of thousands is a dataset, and a dataset should be written
    by the system that owns it - `wrangler kv bulk put` after the apply, or the
    application at runtime - with Terraform owning only the namespace and the
    bindings.

    Raise it deliberately, with the reason written down, rather than because a
    plan failed.
