# One Workers KV namespace, plus any key/value pairs Terraform is asked to own.

# infrastructure - it has an ID that bindings point at, and destroying it takes
# every key with it - while the contents are usually data, written by the
# application or by a bulk load. Managing a few configuration keys here is
# supported and useful; managing a dataset is not, which is what the
# max_managed_pairs precondition is for.
