# It declares the project. It does not deploy one: a Git-sourced project builds
# on push, and a Direct Upload project waits for `wrangler pages deploy` from a
# pipeline this module knows nothing about. An apply that creates a project
# leaves a hostname serving nothing until the first deployment lands.
#
# It also does not put Access in front of anything. That belongs to the
# zerotrust layer; see the `access_destinations` output for the exact
# hostnames to hand it.
