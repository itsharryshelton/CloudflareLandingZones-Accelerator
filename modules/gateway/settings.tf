# Account-level Gateway configuration - the switches that sit above the policy
# set, not inside it.
#
# This is a singleton: Cloudflare stores one configuration object per account at
# /accounts/<id>/gateway/configuration, so there is one resource here and no
# for_each. It already exists on every Zero Trust account, which means the first
# apply against an established account MUST import it first. Without the import
# the provider writes the object from this configuration alone, and anything set
# in the dashboard and not represented here is at risk of being dropped.
#
# The single most consequential field is tls_decrypt. With it off, an HTTP
# policy still exists and still shows as active in the dashboard, but Gateway
# only ever sees the TLS handshake for an HTTPS request - so a rule matching a
# path, a method, a file type or a DLP profile never fires. Practically every
# HTTP policy is inert until this is on.
#
# Keyed by account ID rather than counted so the instance address is stable and
# nameable - `this["<account_id>"]` is what the caller's import block adopts, and
# it does not shift if the resource is ever made conditional on something else.
