# Cloudflare Gateway - the Secure Web Gateway policy set for one account.
#
# Three enforcement pipelines, not one list: a DNS policy is resolved before a
# connection exists, a network policy sees the L4 connection and the TLS SNI, and
# an HTTP policy sees the decrypted request. Gateway walks each in ascending
# precedence and stops at the first allow or block that matches, which is why
# precedence is an input here rather than something derived from list order.
#
# Expression compilation lives in locals.tf. The preconditions below are the
# checks that need more than one input, so they cannot be variable validations.
