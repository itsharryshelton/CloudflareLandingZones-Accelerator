# One Bulk Redirect List. Normalisation lives in locals.tf.
#
# THE LIST AND ITS CONTENTS ARE SEPARABLE, ON PURPOSE
# Cloudflare models a list as a named container plus rows, and the provider's
# `items` field is all-or-nothing: "If set, this overwrites all items in the
# list." So there are exactly two coherent postures, and `manage_items` picks
# between them rather than leaving it to whether somebody happened to pass rows.
#
#   manage_items = false  Terraform owns the container. Rows are loaded through
#                         the Lists API - PUT .../rules/lists/<id>/items replaces
#                         the whole list in one asynchronous operation. This is
#                         what a real redirect table wants: the rows stay out of
#                         state and out of every plan.
#
#   manage_items = true   Terraform owns the rows too, and any row written by
#                         anything else is removed on the next apply.
#
# Nothing here creates the rule that switches the list on. A list is inert until
# an http_request_redirect rule references it, which is the bulk_redirect_ruleset
# module - one ruleset per account, not one per list.
