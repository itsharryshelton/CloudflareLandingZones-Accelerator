    False - the default - creates the list and leaves the rows alone, so they can

    anything of size: a bulk redirect table is data, and Terraform would hold
    every row in state and re-plan all of them on every run.

    True hands the rows to Terraform, and Cloudflare's `items` field then
    overwrites the whole list on every apply. A row loaded by any other means is
    deleted the next time this applies. Use it only for a list small enough that
    the rows belong in a plan.

    Switching from true to false does not delete anything: Terraform stops
    managing the rows and leaves them in place.

    The redirects, when `manage_items` is true.

      - source_url           : hostname and path, e.g. "www.example.com/old". The
                               scheme is optional and is best omitted - without
                               one the redirect matches both http and https. A
                               query string is NOT allowed here; Cloudflare
                               matches on the URL up to the "?" only.
      - target_url           : where to send the request. A full URL including
                               the scheme, e.g. "https://www.example.com/new".
                               Bulk Redirects do not resolve a relative target
                               against the request, which is the main difference
                               from a Worker doing the same job.
      - status_code          : 301, 302, 307 or 308. Cloudflare defaults to 301.
                               301 and 308 are cached by browsers more or less
                               permanently - a wrong one is very hard to take
                               back.
      - preserve_query_string: carry the incoming query string to the target. Any
                               query string already on the target is discarded
                               when this is on.
      - include_subdomains   : also match subdomains of the source hostname, so
                               "example.com/a" matches "shop.example.com/a".
      - subpath_matching     : also match paths below the source path, so
                               "example.com/dir" matches "example.com/dir/page".
      - preserve_path_suffix : with subpath matching on, carry the unmatched tail
                               of the path onto the target. Meaningless without
                               `subpath_matching`.
      - comment              : per-row note, stored with the item.

    A source_url is matched exactly unless `include_subdomains` or
    `subpath_matching` widens it. That exactness is the point: a bulk list is a
    lookup table, not a pattern language. Anything needing a substitution or a
    regular expression is a Single Redirect instead.
