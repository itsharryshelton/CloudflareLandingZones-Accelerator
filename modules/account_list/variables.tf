    Whether Terraform owns the contents of this list.

    False - the default - creates the list and leaves the rows alone. That is the
    right posture for an operationally maintained list: an address the security
    team adds during an incident must not be reverted by the next unrelated
    apply, and Cloudflare's `items` field is all-or-nothing ("If set, this
    overwrites all items in the list").

    True hands the rows to Terraform, so every row is in state and in every
    plan. Use it for a small, deliberate list - corporate egress ranges, a
    partner's payment gateway addresses - where a change ought to be read in a
    plan before it takes effect.

    Switching true to false does not delete anything: Terraform stops managing
    the rows and leaves them in place.
