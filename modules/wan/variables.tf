                                  to be.

                                  table, so traffic keeps being sent into a dead
                                  tunnel.
      - bgp                     : dynamic routing instead of static routes.
                                  `customer_asn` is the ASN on your device,
                                  `extra_prefixes` are advertised to it on top of
                                  the Magic routing table, and `md5_key` is a
                                  session key. Cloudflare's own documentation says
                                  the MD5 key is not a security measure and is not
                                  treated as a secret; it prevents

    ON THE PSK. Terraform records what it sends, so a PSK reaches state in plain
    text however it is supplied. It must therefore never be written into a
    `.tfvars` file - it arrives from the deployment's environment. See the
    `wan_ipsec_tunnel_psks` variable in layers/wan for how that is wired.

    Leave `psk` unset and Cloudflare generates one at creation. That is a real
    option, and often the better one, but understand the trade: the generated
    value is not returned to Terraform, so the only place to read it is the
    Cloudflare dashboard, and the device at the other end has to be configured
    from there by hand.

    The Magic routing table: which of your prefixes Cloudflare reaches over which
    tunnel. A tunnel with no route pointing down it carries nothing.

      - prefix      : the network behind the tunnel, in CIDR notation. IPv4 or
                      IPv6.
      - priority    : lower wins. Give a site's tunnels different priorities for
                      active/standby, or the same priority for ECMP across both.
      - nexthop     : the customer-side address of the tunnel. Give this OR
                      `tunnel_name`, not both.
      - tunnel_name : name of a tunnel declared in `gre_tunnels` or
                      `ipsec_tunnels`. The module derives the next hop from that
                      tunnel's interface address, which is the arithmetic worth
                      not doing by hand: the address written in
                      `interface_address` is Cloudflare's own side of the /31, and
                      a route pointing at it is a blackhole that looks correct in
                      the dashboard.
      - weight      : relative share of an ECMP set. Only meaningful with a scope.
      - description : free text, shown in the dashboard.
      - colo_names  : restrict the route to named Cloudflare colos.
      - colo_regions: restrict the route to Cloudflare regions.

    Two routes for the same prefix down two different tunnels is the normal
    shape - it is what makes a site survive one tunnel failing.
