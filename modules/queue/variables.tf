    What reads the queue. Null declares a queue with no consumer at all, which
    accepts messages and delivers none of them until retention expires - or one
    whose consumer is attached by the queue_consumer module, which is required
    wherever the consuming Worker is deployed by the same layer (see main.tf).

    A queue has exactly one consumer. One Worker can consume several queues, and
    any number of Workers can produce to one, but two consumers on a single queue
    is not something Cloudflare offers - a single reader is what makes
    at-least-once delivery possible without two handlers racing for the same
    message.

      - type             : "worker" for push delivery into a Worker's queue()
                           handler, or "http_pull" for a consumer that pulls
                           batches over HTTP on its own schedule.
      - script_name      : the consuming Worker, for type "worker". Cloudflare
                           rejects a consumer naming a Worker that does not exist
                           yet, so it must already be deployed - by another
                           layer or outside Terraform.
      - dead_letter_queue: name of another queue that receives a message once it
                           has failed max_retries times. Without one, a message
                           that keeps failing is dropped and nothing records it.
      - settings         : delivery tuning, below.

    CONSUMER SETTINGS
      - batch_size           : messages delivered at once, 1-100. Default 10.
      - max_wait_time_ms     : how long Cloudflare waits for a batch to fill
                               before delivering a partial one, 0-60000. Push
                               consumers only.
      - max_concurrency      : how many consumer invocations may run at once,
                               1-250. Push consumers only. Left null, Cloudflare
                               scales it against the backlog, which is usually
                               right; cap it where the consumer calls something
                               that cannot take the parallelism.
      - max_retries          : delivery attempts before a message is dead
                               lettered or dropped, 0-100. Default 3.
      - retry_delay          : seconds before a failed message is redelivered,
                               0-86400. Retrying immediately against a failing
                               dependency is only a faster way to exhaust the
                               retries.
      - visibility_timeout_ms: how long a pulled batch is leased before it
                               becomes visible to another pull, up to 43200000
                               (12 hours). Pull consumers only.

    A consumer is handed a batch and either acknowledges it or does not, so a
    handler that throws puts the whole batch back - including the messages it had
    already processed. Acknowledge message by message in the Worker wherever
    partial failure is normal.
