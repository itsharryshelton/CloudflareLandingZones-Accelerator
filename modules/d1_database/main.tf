# One D1 database: Cloudflare's serverless SQLite, bound into a Worker as
# `env.<NAME>` and queried from it. Normalisation lives in locals.tf.
#
# The database is the only resource here. Its schema is not Terraform's to own -
# a migration is an ordered, versioned change to data that has to be applied once
# and in sequence, which is `wrangler d1 migrations apply` run by hand
# against the database_id this module outputs, not a plan that reconciles a
# desired state. Terraform owns the database and the binding; the application
# owns what is inside it.
#
# Every attribute Cloudflare accepts here is fixed at creation. Changing the
# name, the jurisdiction or the location replaces the database, and a replaced D1
# database is an empty one - there is no export taken first.
