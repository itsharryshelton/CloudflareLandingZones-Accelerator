# One Cloudflare AI Gateway and its dynamic routes.
#
# A gateway is a proxy between an application and its AI providers. It logs,
# caches, rate limits and applies DLP, guardrails and spend limits to every
# request sent through it. It is account-scoped and attached to no zone; a
# client reaches it by URL, built from the account ID and the gateway ID.
#
# WHAT TERRAFORM CANNOT DO HERE
# It declares the gateway. It does not point anything at it: an application
# only uses a gateway once its base URL is changed to the gateway's endpoint.
#
# It creates no credential either. Callers of an authenticated gateway need a
# Cloudflare token with AI Gateway Run, and a BYOK gateway needs provider keys
# in Secrets Store with a provider config attaching each one. Provider 5.23 has
# no resource for provider configs (cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare#7332),
# and the Run token is the application's credential, not Terraform's.
#
# Not managed, deliberately, and so left as the dashboard set them:
#   otel                    - exports every prompt and completion to a third-
#                             party collector. Its authorization is a Secrets
#                             Store reference in a format Cloudflare does not
#                             document, and its headers usually carry a
#                             credential the provider does not mark sensitive.
#   stripe                  - carries a Stripe credential, and is documented
#                             nowhere beyond the API schema.
#   workers_ai_billing_mode - provider 5.23 accepts only "postpaid", and sends
#                             it on every update whether set or not. A gateway
#                             switched to Unified Billing in the dashboard is
#                             switched back by the next apply that changes it
#                             (cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare#7331,
#                             fixed in 5.24.0).

# A route's elements cannot be changed in place. The API takes new elements
# as a new version plus a deployment of it, and provider 5.23's update only
# ever sends the route's name - so an edited element list would apply
# "successfully", change nothing, and show the same diff on every plan after.
# Instead, any change to a route's elements replaces the route, through this
# hash: the old route is deleted and a new one created under the same name.
#
# Clients address a route by name, as "dynamic/<name>", so they need no
# change - but requests to that route fail for the seconds between the delete
# and the create, and its version history goes with the old route. Schedule an
# element change on a live route.
