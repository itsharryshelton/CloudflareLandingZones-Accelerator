    Dynamic routes, keyed by route name. A client uses one by sending
    `"model": "dynamic/<name>"` to the gateway's OpenAI-compatible endpoint;
    the other endpoints do not route. Renaming a route breaks every client that
    names it.

    A route is a graph of elements, keyed by element ID. Each element's
    `outputs` maps an output name to the ID of the element that runs next.

      start        outputs: next                  One per route. Runs first.
      conditional  outputs: true, false           conditions = jsonencode({...}):
                                                  $eq, $ne, $in, $and, $or over
                                                  the body, headers or metadata,
                                                  e.g. { "metadata.plan" = { "$eq" = "free" } }
      rate         outputs: success, [fallback]   key (e.g. "metadata.user_id"),
                                                  limit, limit_type (count | cost),
                                                  window (seconds). Per-value limit,
                                                  unlike the gateway's rate_limit.
      model        outputs: success, [fallback]   provider, model, retries,
                                                  timeout (milliseconds).
      end          (none)                         Returns the last successful model
                                                  response, or an error.

    fallback is optional; without it a rate-limited or failed request ends the
    route with an error. Percentage splits are not supported: their outputs are
    keyed by share ("10%"), which provider 5.23 cannot represent. Build a route
    that needs one in the dashboard, outside this module.

    Changing any element replaces the route - see main.tf. Routes need
    authentication on, and Cloudflare's docs expect the providers they call to
    have BYOK keys stored on the gateway.
