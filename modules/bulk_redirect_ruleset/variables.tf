    One rule per Bulk Redirect List, IN EVALUATION ORDER. Cloudflare stops at the
    first rule that redirects, so this is a list rather than a map: position is
    behaviour, and a map would be ordered lexically by key instead.

      - list_name      : the Bulk Redirect List this rule switches on. Must match
                         the list's name exactly - the expression refers to it as
                         `$list_name`.
      - description    : shown against the rule in the dashboard.
      - enabled        : false leaves the rule in place and inert, which is how a
                         list is taken out of service without deleting rows.
      - ref            : stable rule reference. Defaults to the list name, which
                         keeps a rule identifiable across reorders.
      - scope_hostnames: restrict the rule to these exact hostnames.
      - scope_domains  : restrict the rule to these zones - the apex and every
                         subdomain of each.

    SCOPING IS A BLAST-RADIUS CONTROL, NOT A ROUTING MECHANISM
    Every row already carries its own hostname, so an unscoped rule is correct and
    is the usual configuration. Scoping matters when one account holds several
    brands: it means a bad row loaded into one brand's list cannot redirect
    another brand's traffic, however wrong the source hostname on that row is.

    Both scope fields on one rule are combined with OR, and the result is ANDed
    with the list lookup.
