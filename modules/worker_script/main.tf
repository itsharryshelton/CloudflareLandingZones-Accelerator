# One Worker: the script itself, what it is allowed to reach, and everything that
# can invoke it - routes, custom domains and cron triggers. Normalisation lives in
# locals.tf.
#
# Cloudflare also ships beta `cloudflare_worker`, `cloudflare_worker_version` and
# `cloudflare_workers_deployment` resources, which model immutable versions and
# gradual rollout. They are the direction of travel and are worth revisiting once
# they leave beta; `cloudflare_workers_script` is used here because a landing zone
# should not pin an account to a beta resource whose state shape may still change.
