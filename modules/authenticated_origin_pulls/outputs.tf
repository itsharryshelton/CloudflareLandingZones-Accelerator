    This is the file the origin's client-certificate trust store takes:
      - NGINX: write it to disk, then `ssl_client_certificate <path>;` with
        `ssl_verify_client on;` in the server block.
      - Azure Application Gateway: upload as a Trusted Client Certificate on the
        SSL profile, and attach that profile to the listener.
    Both verify the chain only. Neither checks WHICH certificate was presented,
    so where the bundle holds more than one, any of them is accepted.

    Empty where the zone uses Cloudflare's default certificate and no CA was
    supplied - there is then nothing here to install, and the origin must trust
    Cloudflare's published Origin Pull CA instead.
