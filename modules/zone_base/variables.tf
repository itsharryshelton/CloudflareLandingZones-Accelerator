    every endpoint reachable over early data is idempotent.

    Additional string-valued zone settings, applied as individual

    the secure baseline in locals.tf; the dedicated `ssl_mode`,
    `min_tls_version`, `tls_1_3` and `always_use_https` variables always take
    precedence over any matching key here.

    The baseline is a local rather than this variable's default on purpose: a
    caller that sets zone_settings at all REPLACES a default wholesale, which is
    exactly what the deployment layers do, and the baseline used to disappear
    without a trace when they did.

    Each key is one resource and one API read per zone per plan, against
    Cloudflare's 1200-requests-per-5-minutes budget. Across many zones that is
    the dominant cost of this module, so pass settings that assert posture
    rather than ones that restate a Cloudflare default.

    Only string-valued settings are supported by this variable; for
    numeric or object-valued settings (e.g. browser_cache_ttl), add a
    cloudflare_zone_setting resource directly. See:
    https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zone_setting

    Note: zone settings cannot be deleted through the Cloudflare API. Removing a
    key here drops it from Terraform state but leaves the value live on the zone.
