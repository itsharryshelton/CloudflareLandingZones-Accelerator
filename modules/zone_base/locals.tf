  #
  # Every entry costs one cloudflare_zone_setting resource per zone, and one
  # Cloudflare API read per zone on every refresh, against a budget of 1200
  # requests per 5 minutes per credential. A caller with a few hundred zones
  # therefore pays for this map several hundred times over on each plan, so the
  # bar for being in it is that Terraform asserting the value defends something
  # - not merely that the value is the one we want.
  #
  # Kept:
  #   automatic_https_rewrites  rewrites HTTP subresources to HTTPS, so it is
  #                             part of the mixed-content posture the ssl and
  #                             always_use_https settings below establish.
  #   browser_check             a threat control. If someone turns it off in the
  #                             dashboard, Terraform should pull it back on.
  #
  # Removed, both of which are "on" by Cloudflare default on every plan and
  # neither of which is a security control:
  #   opportunistic_encryption  upgrades HTTP clients that advertise support. No
  #                             posture is lost by not asserting it, because
  #                             always_use_https redirects those clients anyway.
  #   http3                     a transport performance feature.
  #
  # Removing a setting plans a destroy for it. cloudflare_zone_setting has no
  # delete operation - the provider's Delete is an empty function - so that
  # drops the resource from state and leaves the value untouched at Cloudflare.
  # A caller that wants either back can set it in var.zone_settings.
