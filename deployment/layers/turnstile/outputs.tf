# Deliberately not exported.
#
# The backend's /siteverify secret is in module.turnstile.secrets, and it is in
# this layer's state either way. Re-exporting it here would put it in the root
# outputs, which are printed after every apply and are what a `terraform output`
# in a log and a state consumer read. Read one deliberately when handing it
# over, straight from state - the command is under "Secrets" in the Turnstile
# section of deployment/README.md -
# and if that is ever needed routinely, the answer is a secrets manager, not an
# output. Rotating a secret is not possible in place: a new secret means a new
# widget, which means a new sitekey and a redeploy of every page that embeds it.
