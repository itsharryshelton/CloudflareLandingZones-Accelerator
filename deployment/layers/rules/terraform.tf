  # No backend is declared, so `terraform init` uses the local backend and
  # writes terraform.tfstate into this directory. The Accelerator deploys a
  # baseline once, from a workstation, so there is no pipeline or second
  # operator to share state with. .gitignore keeps the file out of version
  # control; the root README covers what to do with it after handover.
