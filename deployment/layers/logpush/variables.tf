  description = <<-EOT
    Logpush jobs, keyed by a logical key. The key is identity: renaming it
    destroys the job and creates a new one, and nothing is backfilled for the
    events in between.

    - `dataset`          - The log category, e.g. "http_requests",
                           "firewall_events", "audit_logs", "gateway_dns". A zone
                           dataset needs `zone_key`; an account dataset must not
                           have one. See var.logpush_zone_datasets and
                           var.logpush_account_datasets. Changing it replaces the
                           job.
    - `zone_key`         - (Optional) A key from zones.tfvars, for a zone-scoped
                           job. Leave it out for an account-scoped one. The zone
                           must be on var.logpush_min_zone_tier or above.
    - `name`             - (Optional) Label in the dashboard. Not unique, not
                           identity.
    - `destination_conf` - (Optional) Where the logs go, for a destination with no
                           credential in its URI:
                             "s3://<bucket>/<path>/{DATE}?region=eu-west-2&sse=AES256"
                             "gs://<bucket>/<path>/{DATE}"
                           Leave it out for any destination that carries one - R2,
                           Splunk, Datadog, Azure, an HTTP endpoint with an auth
                           header - and supply the whole URI in
                           var.logpush_destination_secrets under this job's key.
                           Exactly one of the two per job. A credential-shaped
                           value here fails the plan.
    - `enabled`          - (Optional) Falls back to var.default_logpush_job_enabled.
    - `filter`           - (Optional) Cloudflare's filter JSON, selecting which
                           events to push. A heredoc keeps it readable:
                             filter = <<-JSON
                               {"where":{"and":[{"key":"ClientRequestHost","operator":"eq","value":"example.com"}]}}
                             JSON
                           Unset pushes every event.
    - `kind`             - (Optional) "" (default), or "edge" for Edge Log
                           Delivery, which is http_requests only.
    - `max_upload_bytes`, `max_upload_interval_seconds`, `max_upload_records`
                         - (Optional) Batch limits: 5 MB to 1 GB, 30 to 300
                           seconds, 1,000 to 1,000,000 records, or 0 for
                           Cloudflare's default. A shorter interval gets events to
                           a SIEM sooner, in more and smaller files.
    - `output_options`   - Record shape. `field_names` is required: Cloudflare has
                           no "all fields" option, and each dataset's page in the
                           Logpush docs lists its fields. `output_type`,
                           `timestamp_format` and `cve_2021_44228` fall back to the
                           platform defaults below. A `sample_rate` below 1 is
                           restricted - see var.allow_logpush_sampling.
                           `merge_subrequests`, `batch_*`, `record_*` and
                           `field_delimiter` as Cloudflare documents them.

    ENTERPRISE ONLY. On an account without Logpush, leave this map empty.

    again:

      TF_VAR_logpush_destination_secrets={"audit_archive":"r2://..."}

    A credential written into a .tfvars is committed the moment somebody runs
    `git add .`, and .gitignore will not save you: deployment/config/*.tfvars is
    explicitly un-ignored so the config can be committed. The plan fails on a
    credential-shaped destination_conf in logpush.tfvars, but that is a
    backstop, not a control.

    The value lands in this layer's local state file, and in any saved plan, in
    plain text, because Terraform records what it sent. Both are credential
    material. Scope each credential to the one bucket or index it writes to: an
    R2 token on the log bucket alone, a Splunk HEC token bound to one index.
