variable "account_members" {
  description = <<-EOT
    People who may sign in to this Cloudflare account, keyed by a logical key.

    Unlike `zones`, the key here is a handle, not identity: user groups reference
    a member by it, and renaming one moves nothing in Cloudflare because
    memberships are keyed on the email address. Changing an `email` is the
    destructive edit - it revokes the old address and sends a fresh invitation.

    - `email`      - The person's address. Cloudflare emails them an invitation;
                     they cannot sign in until they accept it.
    - `role_names` - (Optional) Account role names as they appear in the
                     dashboard under Manage Account, then Members, for example
                     "Administrator Read Only" or "DNS". Matched
                     case-insensitively. Defaults to var.default_role_names.
    - `role_ids`   - (Optional) Role IDs, for a role whose name is ambiguous or
                     absent from the dashboard list. Merged with role_names.
    - `status`     - (Optional) Leave unset. The attribute is computed, so an
                     invitation moving from pending to accepted is not drift. Set
                     it only to force a state, and be aware that dragging an
                     accepted member back to "pending" replaces the membership:
                     they lose access and are re-invited.

    Deleting an entry revokes that person's access on the next apply.

variable "user_groups" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Named permission bundles granted to several members at once, keyed by a
    logical key. Use one wherever the same permission set would otherwise be
    typed out per member.

    The key is a handle. The `name` is identity: renaming it destroys and
    recreates the group, and its members lose the group's permissions until the
    apply finishes.

    - `name`        - Display name in the dashboard.
    - `member_keys` - (Optional) Keys from var.account_members. The layer
                      resolves them to membership IDs, so a new member and their
                      group placement can land in one apply.
    - `member_ids`  - (Optional) Membership IDs of people deliberately managed
                      outside Terraform. Not revoked by this layer.
    - `policies`    - At least one. Each entry grants or denies a set of
                      permissions over a set of resources:
                        - `access`                 - (Optional) "allow" or "deny". Defaults to allow.
                        - `permission_group_names` - Permission group names, for example
                                                     "DNS Write". Matched case-insensitively.
                        - `permission_group_ids`   - (Optional) IDs, merged with the names above.
                        - `resource_group_names`   - (Optional) Resource group names. Left empty,
                                                     the policy covers the whole account.
                        - `resource_group_ids`     - (Optional) IDs, merged with the names above.

    Cloudflare evaluates deny before allow, which makes a deny policy a workable
    way to carve one capability back out of a broad grant.
