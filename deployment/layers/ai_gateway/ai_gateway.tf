# Cloudflare AI Gateway: gateways and their dynamic routes.
#
# Its own layer, not part of workers, because a gateway is not compute and is
# attached to no zone. It is a proxy in front of AI providers, reached by URL,
# with its own permission group - and a change to its DLP, guardrails and
# spend limits should plan apart from the Workers that call it. It reads
# nothing and nothing reads it.
#
# What makes a gateway useful is outside this layer: the application's base
# URL, the Run token its callers authenticate with, and any BYOK provider keys
# in Secrets Store. See outputs.tf for the endpoints to hand over, and
# imports.tf before a first apply against an account already using AI Gateway.
#
# Modules are sourced by relative path from this repository's modules/
# directory, so a clone is self-contained and there is no tag to pin.
