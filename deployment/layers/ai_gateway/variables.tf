# Layer ai_gateway - inputs.
#
# Cloudflare AI Gateway: the proxy an application sends its LLM traffic
# through, for logging, caching, rate limits, DLP, guardrails, spend limits and
# dynamic routing across providers. Account-scoped and attached to no zone, so
# this layer holds its own state and reads nothing else.
#
# It declares gateways and their routes. It does not change an application's
# base URL, create the token its callers authenticate with, or store the BYOK
# provider keys a gateway spends on.
#
# Config files:
#   config/account.tfvars    - the account ID, shared with every layer
#   config/ai_gateway.tfvars - the gateways, consumed only here

  description = <<-EOT
    AI gateways, keyed by a logical key. The key is the state address and what
    the outputs are keyed by. Renaming one plans a delete and a create of the
    same gateway_id in no guaranteed order: the create is refused while the ID
    still exists, or it lands after the delete and the logs are gone. Rename a
    key with a `moved` block.

    - `gateway_id`          - The gateway's ID and the path segment in every
                              client's base URL. FIXED AT CREATION: a change
                              replaces the gateway, deletes its logs and routes,
                              and breaks every client using the old URL.
                              "default" is Cloudflare's auto-created gateway -
                              import it, see imports.tf.
    - `authentication`      - (Optional) Falls back to var.default_authentication.
                              false is gated by var.allow_unauthenticated_gateways.
    - `collect_logs`        - (Optional) Falls back to var.default_collect_logs.
                              Logs are full prompts and responses.
    - `log_storage`         - (Optional) max_logs (10000-10000000) and when_full
                              (DELETE_OLDEST | STOP_INSERTING). Each falls back to
                              var.default_log_storage.
    - `cache`               - (Optional) { ttl, invalidate_on_update }. Omit for off.
    - `rate_limit`          - (Optional) { limit, interval, technique }. Omit for off.
    - `retries`             - (Optional) { max_attempts, delay_ms, backoff }.
    - `zero_data_retention` - (Optional, default false) Unified Billing traffic to
                              OpenAI and Anthropic only. Not a logging switch.
    - `logpush_public_key`  - (Optional) RSA public key, PEM. Never the private one.
    - `secrets_store_id`    - (Optional) The Secrets Store holding BYOK keys.
    - `dlp_policies`        - (Optional) policy ID => { action, check, profiles, enabled }.
    - `guardrails`          - (Optional) { prompt, response }, category => FLAG | BLOCK.
    - `spend_limits`        - (Optional) rule ID => { limit (USD), window, ... }.
    - `routes`              - (Optional) route name => { elements }.

    Every field is described in full on the matching variable of
    modules/ai_gateway, which is where it is validated.

    A NEW GATEWAY MAY NEED TWO APPLIES
    Cloudflare's create call does not take dlp_policies, guardrails or
    spend_limits - only its update call does. Plan again after the apply that
    creates a gateway declaring any of them, and apply what that plan shows,
    before pointing a client at it.
