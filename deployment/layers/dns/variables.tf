    Zone inventory: the logical key => domain name mapping for this account,

    resolves a zone key to a zone ID.

    This layer reads `domain_name` and nothing else - it is what
    data.cloudflare_zone filters on to turn a dns_config key into a zone ID.

    The key is permanent identity. It has to match the key used in dns.tfvars,
    and renaming it in the zones layer destroys and recreates the zone, which
    takes every DNS record with it.

    - `domain_name` - The apex domain (e.g. example.com).
    - `zone_tier`   - (Optional) Declared only so this file remains passable to
                      this layer; a var file carrying an attribute the root
                      module does not accept is rejected outright. The rate plan
                      is the zones layer's business, and nothing here reads it.

variable "dns_config" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Per-zone DNS records, keyed by the same zone key as var.zones.

    Split out of the zones layer's `zone_config` rather than sharing it: no two
    files in deployment/config/ may assign the same variable, because that is
    what makes the layer-to-var-file mapping derivable (see scripts/cflz.sh). So
    the zones layer keeps `zone_config` for zone settings and TLS posture, and
    this layer owns `dns_config` for records.

    A zone key with no entry here simply has no Terraform-managed records. A key
    that is not in var.zones fails the plan - see preflight.tf - because the
    alternative is a records block that silently applies to nothing.
