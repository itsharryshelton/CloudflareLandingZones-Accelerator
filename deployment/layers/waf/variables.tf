    A map of WAF policies, one per zone that needs custom firewall or rate

    - `zone_key`                - The key of the zone this policy binds to. Taken from `var.zones`.
    - `bot_traffic`             - (Optional) Per-behaviour handling of verified bot traffic:

                                  This is in the waf layer, not the zones layer, because
                                  Cloudflare allows one entry-point ruleset per phase per
                                  zone and this layer owns http_request_firewall_custom. The

                                  Mode, ai_bots_protection) are `bot_management` in the zones
                                  layer's zone_config.tfvars.

                                  Matches VERIFIED bots only. An AI crawler that hides what
                                  it is has no category and is unaffected - use
                                  ai_bots_protection in the zones layer for that.
    - `baseline_custom_rules`   - (Optional) Names of baseline rules from the platform
                                  catalogue in locals.waf.tf.
    - `baseline_rate_limits`    - (Optional) Names of baseline rate limits from the same catalogue.
    - `baseline_managed_rulesets` - (Optional) Names of Cloudflare-authored managed
                                  rulesets from the catalogue in locals.waf.tf -
                                  currently `cloudflare_managed` and `owasp_core`.
                                  These land under "Managed rules" in the dashboard,
                                  not under custom rules, and are evaluated in a

    - `managed_rulesets`        - (Optional) Managed rulesets named by raw Cloudflare
                                  ruleset ID, appended after the baseline ones. Use
                                  this for a ruleset the catalogue does not carry
                                  (an application-specific one such as Drupal or
                                  WordPress); anything the whole estate should run
                                  belongs in the catalogue instead.
    - `baseline_managed_exceptions` - (Optional) WAF exceptions from the catalogue in
                                  locals.waf.tf, keyed by name - currently
                                  `html_submission`. Each takes the `hostnames`
                                  it applies to, and they are required: an exception
                                  scoped only by path would cover every host on the
                                  zone. Placed ahead of the managed rulesets, and
                                  only skips the rulesets this policy executes.
    - `managed_exceptions`      - (Optional) Tenant-specific WAF exceptions, appended
                                  after the baseline ones. Same shape as the waf
                                  module's managed_exceptions input. Use these, not a
                                  skip in custom_block_rules, to turn off individual
                                  managed rules or rulesets for narrowly scoped
                                  traffic.
    - `custom_block_rules`      - (Optional) Tenant-specific firewall rules, appended after
                                  the baseline rules so they evaluate later. Actions are
                                  block, challenge, managed_challenge, js_challenge, log and
                                  skip. A skip rule needs a `skip` block naming what to stop
                                  evaluating, and turns protection OFF for whatever it
                                  matches - scope it to a path and a method, not to a
                                  hostname. Note the ordering: these are appended after the
                                  baseline, so a skip here cannot undo a baseline block that
                                  has already fired.
    - `rate_limiting_rules`     - (Optional) Tenant-specific rate limits, appended after the
                                  baseline rate limits.
    - `custom_ruleset_name`     - (Optional) Dashboard display name for the custom ruleset.
    - `rate_limit_ruleset_name` - (Optional) Dashboard display name for the rate limit ruleset.
    - `managed_ruleset_name`    - (Optional) Dashboard display name for the managed rules ruleset.

    Baseline rules are parameterised by `waf_trusted_ip_ranges`, `waf_admin_paths`
    and `waf_blocked_countries` rather than hardcoded, so the catalogue serves
    every customer.

    PL1 is Cloudflare's default and is the only level that can be considered
    safe for general traffic. Each level above it trades false negatives for
    false positives, steeply: PL3 and PL4 exist for applications with a narrow,
    well-understood request shape, and will block ordinary requests on anything
    else. Raise this only alongside waf_owasp_score_threshold, and only after
    running the result in log mode.

    Cloudflare's published sensitivities: 60 = low, 40 = medium (their default),

    setting and 60 the permissive one - which is the opposite of how the number

    predict from the configuration than a single managed rule is.

    Routes that accept HTML in the request body by design, as regular

    anchors them at both ends, so "/templates/[0-9]+" matches /templates/12 and
    nothing longer. Anything in front of the route, such as a version or locale
    prefix, has to be part of the pattern.

    Deliberately empty in the platform defaults: the routes depend on the
    application, so set them in waf.tfvars alongside the hostnames.

    Every route listed here stops having its request bodies checked by the
    skipped signatures on the hostnames a policy names, so keep each entry to
    one route shape rather than a prefix.

    The exception uses the `matches` operator, which Cloudflare offers on
    Business and above.

    serves every zone that uses the exception. Add to it from Security Events:
    filter on the exception's hostnames and the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset, and

    Cloudflare adds signatures over time, so expect this list to keep growing.
