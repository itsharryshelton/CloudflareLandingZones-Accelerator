# Cross-variable checks. A module block cannot carry lifecycle.precondition and
# variable validation cannot compare two variables, so they live on a state-only
# resource from Terraform's built-in provider. No credentials, no API calls.
#
# This layer resolves nothing through the API, so every condition here is decided
# from variables alone and fires offline, with a dummy credential.
