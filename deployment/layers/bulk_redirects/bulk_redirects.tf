# Bulk Redirects: one list per bulk_redirect_lists entry, and the single
# account-level ruleset that switches them on.
#
# A list is inert until a rule names it, and a rule fails to apply if its list
# does not exist yet - so the ruleset depends on every list explicitly. Nothing in
# the rule's inputs references a list module output (the rule needs only the
# name, which comes from the variable), which is what lets preflight.tf assert on
# the whole configuration at plan time instead of deferring to apply.
#
# Modules are sourced by relative path from this repository's modules/
# directory, so a clone is self-contained and there is no tag to pin.
