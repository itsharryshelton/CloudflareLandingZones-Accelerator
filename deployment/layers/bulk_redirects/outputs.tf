output "bulk_redirect_lists" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Per-list identifiers, keyed by list key. `list_id` is what the load step
    needs:

      LIST_ID=$(terraform -chdir=deployment/layers/bulk_redirects \
                  output -json bulk_redirect_lists | jq -r '.<list_key>.list_id')

    The rows then go to the Lists API under that ID - PUT
    /accounts/<account_id>/rules/lists/$LIST_ID/items. This repository ships no
    loader for them.

    `num_items` counts every row Cloudflare holds, including rows loaded outside
    Terraform. `managed_item_count` counts only the rows this layer owns, and is
    zero on any list whose data comes from the load step - which is the expected
    reading, not a fault.
