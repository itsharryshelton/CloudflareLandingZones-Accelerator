# Layer bulk_redirects - inputs.
#
# Cloudflare Bulk Redirects: the account's redirect lists and the single
# entry-point ruleset that switches them on. Holds its own state, so an apply
# here can never propose destroying a zone.
#
# Config files:
#   config/account.tfvars         - the account ID, shared with every layer
#   config/zones.tfvars           - the zone inventory, shared with every layer
#   config/bulk_redirects.tfvars  - the lists and rules, consumed only here
#
# WHERE THE REDIRECT DATA LIVES
# Not here, and not in a config file. A list's rows are data: a real table runs
# to tens or hundreds of thousands of them, Cloudflare replaces the whole list on
# every write, and Terraform would hold each row in state and re-plan all of them
# on every run. This layer creates the list and the rule; the rows are loaded
# outside Terraform with a PUT to /config/rules/lists/<list_id>/items, against
# the list_id this layer outputs.
#
# Inline `items` exist for the small case - a dozen vanity URLs - and are gated
# behind `manage_items` so that "Terraform owns these rows" is always a decision
# somebody made rather than a side effect of pasting data in.
#
# This layer resolves nothing through the Cloudflare API, so it plans offline,
# with a dummy credential. Every guardrail below can be made to fire that way.

                                 No scheme (so it matches http and https alike)
                                 and no query string (Cloudflare matches up to
                                 the "?" only).
      - `target_url`           - a FULL URL, e.g. "https://www.example.com/new".
                                 Bulk Redirects do not resolve a relative target

                                 back to `var.default_preserve_query_string`.
      - `include_subdomains`   - match subdomains of the source hostname too.
      - `subpath_matching`     - match paths below the source path too.
      - `preserve_path_suffix` - with subpath matching, carry the unmatched tail
                                 onto the target.

    SCOPING
    Every row carries its own hostname, so an unscoped rule is correct and is the
    normal configuration. Scope matters when one account holds several brands: it
    means a wrong row loaded into one brand's list cannot redirect another brand's
    traffic. On a single-brand account it buys nothing.

    A list with no rule here is inert - it holds rows, costs list quota and
    redirects nothing. `var.allow_unreferenced_lists` decides whether that fails
    the plan.

    False is the right default. A Bulk Redirect List is a data store:
    Cloudflare replaces the whole list on every write, so managed rows are in
    state, in every plan and in every apply. Terraform owns the container and the
    rule; the rows are loaded outside it.

    A list opts in with `manage_items = true` when its rows genuinely belong in

    looks correctly enabled. It is the most common way a bulk redirect migration
