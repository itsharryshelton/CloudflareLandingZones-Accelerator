    - `domain_name` - The apex domain (e.g. example.com).

    R2 buckets, keyed by a logical key.

    The key is the Terraform address and the `name` is the bucket's identity in
    Cloudflare. Renaming either destroys and recreates the bucket, and R2 has no
    versioning and no recycle bin, so that takes every object with it.

    - `name`            - Bucket name. Unique within the account and jurisdiction.
    - `location`        - (Optional) Placement hint: apac, eeur, enam, weur, wnam
                          or oc. Honoured only when the bucket is first created.
                          Falls back to `var.default_bucket_location`.
    - `storage_class`   - (Optional) Class for newly uploaded objects: Standard or
                          InfrequentAccess. Falls back to
                          `var.default_storage_class`.
    - `jurisdiction`    - (Optional) Data residency guarantee: default, eu,
                          fedramp or us. Fixed at creation - a bucket cannot be
                          moved between jurisdictions. Falls back to
                          `var.default_jurisdiction`.
    - `cors_rules`      - (Optional) Cross-origin rules. Defaults to none, which
                          is right for a bucket only ever read server-side.
    - `lifecycle_rules` - (Optional) Object expiry and storage class transitions.
                          Leave the field out entirely and the bucket inherits
                          `var.default_lifecycle_rules`; set it to `[]` to say
                          "this bucket deliberately has none".
    - `lock_rules`      - (Optional) Retention. A locked object cannot be deleted
                          by anybody, including Terraform, until retention
                          expires.
    - `public_r2_dev_domain` - (Optional) Serve the bucket anonymously on its
                          pub-<hash>.r2.dev URL. Gated by
                          `var.allow_public_r2_dev_domains`.
    - `custom_domains`  - (Optional) Hostnames in a zone you own that serve the
                          bucket's objects. `zone_key` is taken from `var.zones`,
                          and the hostname must sit inside that zone's domain.

    Anything served publicly is served in full: R2 has no per-object ACL, so a
    public bucket is readable by anyone who knows or guesses a key. Put a Worker
    or Cloudflare Access in front of anything that is not genuinely public.

    bucket, and is otherwise a typo in the `prefix` field.

    Nothing in Terraform calls the Tagging API - the provider has no resource
