# Cloudflare Origin Pull CA

`cloudflare_origin_pull_ca.pem` is Cloudflare's public Origin Pull CA, vendored
so the layer's `origin_trust_bundles` output is complete without a network fetch
at plan time. It is a certificate, not a key: it is public material, published by
Cloudflare, and presented on every origin handshake.

It is what an origin has to trust to verify the client certificate Cloudflare
presents **by default** - that is, on any zone or hostname that has not been
given a certificate of its own through `origin_pull_certificates`.

## Refreshing it

Cloudflare rotates this CA. When they do, replace the file and check its subject,
dates and fingerprint yourself rather than taking the download on trust:

```bash
curl -fsS https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/static/authenticated_origin_pull_ca.pem \
  -o deployment/layers/origin_pulls/ca/cloudflare_origin_pull_ca.pem
openssl x509 -in deployment/layers/origin_pulls/ca/cloudflare_origin_pull_ca.pem \
  -noout -subject -dates -fingerprint -sha256
```

Update the table above in the same commit. To use a different value without
replacing the file, set `cloudflare_origin_pull_ca_certificate` in
`deployment/config/origin_pulls.tfvars`, which wins over this file.
