variable "origin_pulls" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Authenticated Origin Pulls per zone, keyed by the same zone key as
    var.zones. A zone with no entry here is left exactly as Cloudflare has it -
    this layer writes nothing for a zone it was not given.

    - `enabled`         - Zone-level Authenticated Origin Pulls. Covers every
                          hostname in the zone. Defaults to
                          default_zone_level_enabled.
    - `certificate_key` - Key into var.origin_pull_certificates for a client
                          certificate of your own to present zone-wide. Omit to
                          use the certificate Cloudflare presents by default,
                          which every Cloudflare customer's edge also presents -
                          see allow_shared_cloudflare_certificate.
    - `hostnames`       - Per-hostname associations, each binding one hostname
                          to one certificate. This is what gives api.example.com
                          a certificate its origin alone trusts while the rest of
                          the zone keeps the zone-level posture. Where both
                          cover a hostname, Cloudflare applies the per-hostname
                          association.
        - `hostname`        - A relative label ("api") or a name ending in the
                              zone's domain. Qualified against the zone, and
                              rejected if it belongs to another one.
        - `enabled`         - Whether the edge presents the certificate on this
                              hostname's origin connections. Default true; false
                              parks the association without deleting it.
        - `certificate_key` - Key into var.origin_pull_certificates.
        - `certificate_id`  - ID of a certificate already uploaded to the zone
                              outside Terraform. Mutually exclusive with
                              certificate_key.

    Turning any of this on changes nothing at the origin by itself: the origin
    has to be configured to require and verify a client certificate. Apply this
    first, install the origin_trust_bundle output, and switch the origin to
    require a certificate last. Doing it the other way round fails every request
    in between.

    more than one zone or hostname; each zone is only ever handed the
    certificates its own entries name.

    THIS VARIABLE IS NEVER SET FROM A FILE. Set it as the
    TF_VAR_origin_pull_certificates environment variable in the shell that runs
    `cflz plan` and `cflz apply` - both, because a plain `cflz apply` plans
    again and reads it afresh:

      TF_VAR_origin_pull_certificates={"api_origin":{"certificate":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."}}

    Three things follow, and none of them is optional reading.

    A private key written into a .tfvars is committed the moment somebody runs
    `git add .`, and .gitignore will not save you: deployment/config/*.tfvars
    is explicitly un-ignored so the config can be committed.

    The key reaches Terraform state and any saved plan in plain text, because
    Terraform records what it sent. Whoever holds either can present this
    certificate and be accepted by the origin as the Cloudflare edge. See the
    state warning in terraform.tf.

    The newlines matter. PEM is line-structured, and a value flattened to one
    line is rejected by Cloudflare. Encode the file with its line breaks intact -
    `jq -Rs .` over the .pem produces exactly the escaped form above.

    The default certificate is presented by the Cloudflare edge for every
    customer on the platform. An origin that trusts it therefore accepts any
    request proxied through any Cloudflare account, not only this one - so on its
    own it proves the connection came through Cloudflare, not that it came
    through you. That is still worth having as a filter in front of an origin
    that would otherwise accept anything, which is why this defaults to true and
    a `check` warns instead of failing.

    Set false where an origin is relied on to identify the tenant -
    a PCI cardholder-data environment, a shared origin serving several tenants -
    and every zone must then bring its own certificate.

    It reaches the origin_trust_bundle output only for zones that actually rely
    on Cloudflare's default certificate. A zone with a certificate of its own
    gets a bundle holding that certificate alone, because adding the CA would
    make its origin accept the default certificate too - the exact thing the
