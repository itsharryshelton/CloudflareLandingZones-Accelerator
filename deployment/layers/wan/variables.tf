# destroying a zone.

# No zone is involved anywhere in this layer, so it looks nothing up and can be
# planned offline.

# Config files:
#   config/account.tfvars - the account ID, shared with every layer

#   TF_VAR_wan_bgp_md5_keys           - BGP session keys, if any tunnel peers

# CLOUDFLARE WAN IS NOT ENABLED HERE. It is an Enterprise entitlement that
# Cloudflare switches on when it is bought; there is no resource that could turn
# it on, and an account without it fails every call in this layer on

    again and reads it afresh:

      TF_VAR_wan_ipsec_tunnel_psks={"london_primary":"<the psk>"}

    Three things follow, and none of them is optional reading.

    A PSK written into a .tfvars is committed the moment somebody runs
    `git add .`, and .gitignore will not save you: deployment/config/*.tfvars
    is explicitly un-ignored so the config can be committed.

    The value reaches Terraform state in plain text however it is supplied,
    because Cloudflare stores it and Terraform records what it sent. State is
    therefore a credential store: it is the terraform.tfstate in this layer's
    directory, it is never committed, and a saved plan file is exactly as
    sensitive. Anyone holding both the PSK and the tunnel's endpoints can stand
    up the customer end of that tunnel.

    A PSK is the whole of the tunnel's authentication. Generate at least 32
    random characters per tunnel, never reuse one between tunnels or sites, and
    rotate it by updating the environment variable and re-applying - both ends at
    once, because the tunnel drops in between. Omit a tunnel's entry and

variable "allow_tunnels_without_health_checks" {

  default     = false
  description = <<-EOT
    Whether a tunnel may have its health checks switched off.

    Health checks are what make Cloudflare withdraw a failed tunnel from the
    Magic routing table. Without them the route stays in place, traffic keeps
    being sent into a tunnel that is down, and the second tunnel you paid for
    never takes over.

    Left false, a tunnel setting `health_check_enabled = false` fails the plan
    naming it. There are real reasons to want it - a device that cannot answer
    ICMP, a bring-up window - and each of them is worth writing down.

variable "allow_default_static_route" {
  type        = bool
  default     = false
  description = <<-EOT
    Whether a static route may carry the default route, 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0.

    A default route in the Magic routing table sends everything Cloudflare has
    not got a more specific route for towards your network. That is occasionally
    the design - a site whose internet egress is deliberately on-premises - and is
    otherwise the single most effective way to black-hole an estate, because it
    matches every destination nobody thought about.

    Left false, the plan fails naming the route. List the prefixes you actually
    own instead.
  EOT

variable "allow_public_static_route_prefixes" {
  type        = bool
  default     = false
  description = <<-EOT
    Whether a static route's prefix may sit outside private address space.

    Cloudflare WAN routes traffic between your own sites, so its prefixes are
    RFC 1918, RFC 6598 or IPv6 unique-local. A public prefix here means one of
    three things: a typo, an attempt to attract address space the account does
    not own, or Magic Transit - which advertises your public prefixes through
    Cloudflare, is a different product, and is out of scope for this layer.

    Left false, the plan fails naming the route. The default route has its own
    gate, `allow_default_static_route`, and is not reported twice.
  EOT
}

variable "allow_single_tunnel_prefixes" {
  type        = bool
  default     = false
  description = <<-EOT
    Whether a prefix may be reachable over exactly one tunnel.

    One tunnel is a single point of failure with a health check attached: the
    check notices the failure, and there is nowhere for the traffic to go.
    Cloudflare's own guidance is at least two tunnels per site, on separate
    circuits or at least separate devices, and four where the site matters.

    Left false, the plan fails listing each prefix with only one route. Set it
    true for a lab, a pilot site, or a first-tunnel bring-up where the second is
    a known follow-up.
  EOT
}

variable "allow_static_routes_to_unmanaged_nexthops" {
  type        = bool
  default     = false
  description = <<-EOT
    Whether a static route may name a `nexthop` that belongs to no tunnel this
    layer declares.

    The usual cause is a hand-written next hop that is one address out - the
    Cloudflare side of the /31 instead of the customer side, or a neighbouring
    tunnel's. Cloudflare accepts any address, the dashboard shows the route as
    configured, and the traffic is discarded silently. That is why `tunnel_key`
    exists: it derives the address from the tunnel.

    Left false, the plan fails naming the route. Set it true where the tunnel
    genuinely lives elsewhere - a Cloudflare Network Interconnect, or a tunnel
    another team owns.
