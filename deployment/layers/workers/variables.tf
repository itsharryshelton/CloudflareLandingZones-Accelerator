                            duplicates, so include the environment or the brand.
    - `pairs`             - (Optional) Key/value pairs Terraform owns, written
                            inline. For configuration-shaped data only; see
                            `max_managed_pairs`.
    - `pairs_file`        - (Optional) A JSON file under `var.kv_data_dir`
                            holding the same thing, in Cloudflare's bulk format:
                            a list of `{ "key", "value", "base64", "metadata" }`
                            objects, which is what `wrangler kv bulk put` and the
                            KV bulk API both take. Mutually exclusive with

    HOW BULK DATA SHOULD ACTUALLY GET IN
    A namespace holding tens of thousands of rows - a redirect table, a product
    catalogue - does not belong in Terraform state. Terraform writes one key per
    API call, keeps every value in state, and re-plans all of them every run.
    Declare the namespace here, leave `pairs` empty, and load it outside
    Terraform against the namespace ID this layer outputs, which is what
    scripts/kv-bulk-load.sh does after an apply:

      wrangler kv bulk put ./data/bulk/redirects-uk.json --namespace-id "$NAMESPACE_ID" --remote

    That is the supported replacement for hand-rolled curl loops against the KV
    bulk endpoint, and it keeps the data out of the plan while Terraform still
    owns the namespace, the Worker and the binding.

    SECURITY: pairs written here are stored in Terraform state in plain text and
    appear in plan output. Nothing secret goes in KV through this layer.

    SCHEMA AND DATA ARE NOT MANAGED HERE
    Terraform owns the database and the binding; the tables inside it belong to
    the application. A migration is an ordered, one-way change that has to be
    applied in sequence, which is not what a plan reconciling desired state does.

    Migrations are committed to this layer, in a directory named for the same key
    used here:

      layers/workers/migrations/<key>/0001_initial_schema.sql

    scripts/d1-migrations.sh, run by hand after an apply, applies them against
    the ID this layer outputs. See layers/workers/migrations/README.md.

    EVERY FIELD HERE IS REPLACE-ON-CHANGE
    Cloudflare fixes the name, jurisdiction and location when the database is
    created. Editing any of them destroys the database and creates another, and a
    destroyed D1 database takes every row with it - there is no snapshot and no
    undo. A plan that proposes replacing a database is a plan to lose its data;
    read it as such and export first.

                                   paused in the dashboard is un-paused by the

    - `message_retention_period` - (Optional) Seconds an unconsumed message is
                                   kept, 60 to 1209600. Falls back to

    - `consumer`                 - (Optional) The one thing that reads the queue.

    CONSUMER
    A queue has exactly one consumer. One Worker may consume several queues, and
    any number of Workers may produce to one.

      - `type`                  - "worker" (default) for push delivery into a
                                  Worker's queue() handler, or "http_pull".
      - `worker_key`            - a key from `var.worker_scripts`, resolved to
                                  that Worker's name. Use this rather than
                                  `script_name` for a Worker this layer owns: the
                                  reference is also what makes Terraform deploy
                                  the Worker before attaching the consumer.
      - `script_name`           - a Worker owned elsewhere, named directly.
      - `dead_letter_queue_key` - a key from this same map, resolved to that
                                  queue's name.
      - `dead_letter_queue`     - a queue owned elsewhere, named directly.
      - `settings`              - batch_size, max_concurrency, max_retries,
                                  max_wait_time_ms, retry_delay and
                                  visibility_timeout_ms. See the queue_consumer
                                  module's `settings` description for what each
                                  one does and which consumer type it applies to.

    WHAT A QUEUE IS FOR
    A producer writes and returns; the consumer runs later, retries on failure,
    and cannot make the visitor wait. That is the whole point - work that must not
    fail the request, and work that is slower than the request. It is also why an
    unconsumed queue is dangerous rather than idle: producers keep succeeding
    while the backlog ages out at the retention period, and nothing reports what
    was dropped.

                             so no config file carries a hex string.
      - `d1_database_key`  - a key from `var.d1_databases`, resolved to that
                             database's UUID, for a `d1` binding.
      - `queue_key`        - a key from `var.queues`, resolved to that queue's
                             name, for a `queue` binding. This is the producer
                             side: a Worker with this binding writes to the
                             queue, and the consumer is declared on the queue
                             itself.
      - `worker_key`       - a key from `var.worker_scripts`, resolved to that
                             Worker's name, for a `service` binding between two
                             Workers this layer owns.

    Everything else is passed straight to the module: `bucket_name` for r2_bucket,
    `text` for plain_text, `json` for json, `store_id` + `secret_name` for
    secrets_store_secret, and so on. The module's `bindings` description carries
    the full table.

    A binding is a capability. Anything reachable through `env` is reachable by
    every code path in the Worker, including one an attacker reaches through a
    parsing bug. Bind the namespace it needs, not the account's.
