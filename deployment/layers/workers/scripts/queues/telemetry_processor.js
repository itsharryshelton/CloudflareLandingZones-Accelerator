/**
 * Telemetry ingest and batch writer.
 * NOTE: This .js file is purely an example, showing how a Worker uses the queue
 * and D1 bindings that config/workers.tfvars declares.
 *
 * Two handlers, which is the whole point of the pattern:
 *   fetch() is the producer. It validates an event, puts it on the queue and
 *           returns 202. Nothing the caller waits on touches the database, so a
 *           D1 outage costs a slower write later rather than a failed request
 *           now.
 *   queue() is the consumer. It receives up to batch_size events at once and
 *           writes them in one round trip, which is the difference between one
 *           D1 write per batch and one per request.
 *
 * Bindings (configured via config/workers.tfvars):
 *   TELEMETRY_QUEUE  queue  Producer side. Writes are visible to the consumer
 *                           after the queue's delivery_delay, if any.
 *   TELEMETRY_DB     d1     The database this Worker writes batches into.
 *
 * The consumer side - which queue delivers to this Worker, in what batch size,
 * with how many retries and into which dead letter queue - is declared on the
 * queue in workers.tfvars, not here. A queue has exactly one consumer.
 *
 * The table is created by a migration, not by Terraform and not by this Worker:
 * ../../migrations/<database_key>/0001_initial_schema.sql, applied by running
 * scripts/d1-migrations.sh by hand after the apply. The columns this file reads
 * and writes - id, occurred, kind, payload - are defined there.

 * Rejects anything that should never reach the queue. A message that cannot be
 * written will fail every retry and end up in the dead letter queue, so the
