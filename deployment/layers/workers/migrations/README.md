# `migrations` - D1 schema, one directory per database

```
migrations/
  <database_key>/
    0001_initial_schema.sql
    0002_add_kind_index.sql
```

`<database_key>` is the logical key from `d1_databases` in
`deployment/config/workers.tfvars` - the same key a `d1` binding uses - so
nothing here carries a database name or a UUID. Run
[`d1-migrations.sh`](../../../../scripts/d1-migrations.sh) by hand after
`cflz apply workers`: it reads the layer's `d1_databases` output, finds the
directory matching each key and applies whatever has not run yet. A database
with no directory here is skipped; a directory naming no database fails the run
rather than being quietly ignored.

Migrations live in the layer rather than in `deployment/config/` for the same
reason Worker source does: they are code, not configuration. With no D1 database
declared at all, nothing here is touched, but once `workers.tfvars` declares any
D1 database it must declare every key that has a directory here, or the run
fails before anything is applied.

## Why not Terraform

Terraform reconciles a desired state. It has no concept of "0003 ran and 0004 has
not", it cannot apply two files in order, and a resource removed from
configuration is one it proposes to destroy - so `CREATE TABLE` as a Terraform
resource is a plan that eventually offers to drop a table because somebody
deleted a file.

The layer owns the database and the binding. wrangler keeps a `d1_migrations`
table inside each database recording which file names it has run, which is what
makes running the script twice a no-op.

## Naming

`<0000>_<description>.sql`, four zero-padded digits. wrangler orders by that
number and records the file name it applied, so:

- **A name is permanent.** Renaming an applied migration makes wrangler apply it
  again, under its new name, to a database that already has the change.
- **Editing an applied migration does nothing.** The name is already in
  `d1_migrations`, so the edit is never executed and the file now describes a
  schema that was never created. Add another migration instead.
- **Numbers are unique within a directory.** Two files sharing one leaves the
  order between them up to the filesystem, which the script refuses.
- **No empty files.** An empty or whitespace-only file is refused: wrangler would
  record it as applied and apply nothing, using up its number. Only `*.sql` files
  are considered, and four digits cap a directory at 9999 migrations.

## Writing one

Idempotent statements where SQLite offers them (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`,
`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`), so a migration that failed halfway - D1 applies a
file as one statement batch, not one transaction - can be re-run.

Treat a migration that drops a table or a column as a one-way door. D1's Time
Travel can restore a database to an earlier point, but that rewinds every write
since, not just the migration. The script prints a warning naming the file rather
than refusing it, because the decision belongs to whoever wrote the file.
It greps every `.sql` file here for `DROP TABLE`, `DROP INDEX`, `DROP VIEW`,
`DROP COLUMN`, `TRUNCATE` and `DELETE FROM`, applied or not, so the warning repeats
on every run for as long as such a file is in the directory.

## Running it

From the repository root, after `cflz apply workers`. `DRY_RUN=1` lists what
would be applied without applying it:

```bash
DRY_RUN=1 bash scripts/d1-migrations.sh
bash scripts/d1-migrations.sh
```

It defaults to `deployment/layers/workers`, reads the same Cloudflare credential
as `cflz` from the environment - `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` and `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`, or
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; see
[VARIABLES_AND_SECRETS.md](../../../../VARIABLES_AND_SECRETS.md) - and takes the
account ID from `deployment/config/account.tfvars`. It needs bash 4 or newer, jq,
terraform and npx (Node.js; wrangler 4 is fetched through npx). On Windows run it
from Git Bash or WSL.

It reads the database IDs out of the layer's state, so it has to run on the
machine that ran the apply, where the layer's `terraform.tfstate` is. If the
layer has not been applied there, the script reports that the layer has no
`d1_databases` output - "nothing to migrate" - and exits 0. Check for that line
before trusting a dry run.
