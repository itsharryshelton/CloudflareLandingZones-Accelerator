# Workers and the state behind them: one namespace per kv_namespaces entry, one
# database per d1_databases entry, one queue per queues entry, and one Worker per
# worker_scripts entry with its bindings, routes, custom domains and cron
# triggers.
#
# Storage is declared first and referenced by key, so a binding is written as
# `kv_namespace_key = "config"` and Terraform works out the ordering. Nothing in
# workers.tfvars ever carries a namespace ID, a database UUID or a queue ID.
#
# Ordering around queues is worth knowing about, because it is a loop that only
# stays open by being written this way. A queue must exist before a Worker can be
# given a binding that writes to it, and the Worker must exist before it can be
# named as that queue's consumer - so the chain is queue, Worker, consumer.
#
# That is three module calls, not two. `module.queues[binding.queue_key]` has a
# key only known at evaluation, so Terraform makes it depend on everything inside
# module.queues, not just queue_name. A consumer attached inside module.queues
# would therefore make every Worker wait on a consumer that is waiting on a
# Worker - a cycle, reported at validate.
#
# Modules are sourced by relative path from this repository's modules/
# directory, so a clone is self-contained and there is no tag to pin.
