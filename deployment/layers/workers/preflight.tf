# Cross-variable checks. A module block cannot carry lifecycle.precondition and

# Every condition here reads var.* or local.worker_baseline, never the resolved
# local.worker_scripts: that one carries module outputs, which are unknown until
# apply, and a precondition on an unknown value is deferred to apply - which is
