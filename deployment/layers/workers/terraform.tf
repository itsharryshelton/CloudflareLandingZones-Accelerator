  # No backend is declared, so `terraform init` uses the local backend and
  # writes terraform.tfstate into this directory. The Accelerator deploys a
  # baseline once, from a workstation, so there is no pipeline or second
  # operator to share state with. .gitignore keeps the file out of version
  # control; the root README covers what to do with it after handover.
  #
  # This layer's state is worth treating as more sensitive than most. Any KV pair
  # it manages is held in state in plain text, and so is the value of any
  # secret_text binding - which is the reason var.allow_inline_secret_text
  # defaults to false and a Secrets Store binding is the documented alternative.
