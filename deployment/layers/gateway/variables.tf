variable "gateway_policies" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Gateway policies for this account, keyed by a logical key.

    The key is a handle and renaming it destroys and recreates the policy - which
    for a block is a moment with the rule absent, and for an allow is a moment
    with it present. The `name` is what the dashboard and the Gateway logs show.

    - `name`              - Display name in the Zero Trust dashboard.
    - `type`              - "dns", "network" or "http". Three separate enforcement
                            pipelines, not three sections of one list:
                              dns     - answered before a connection exists. Cheapest
                                        to enforce, and blind to anything past the
                                        hostname. Also the one a device using
                                        DNS-over-HTTPS to a third party can sidestep,
                                        which is why the same block is usually worth
                                        repeating at http.
                              network - the L4 connection: ports, protocols, IPs and
                                        the TLS SNI. No visibility into the payload.
                              http    - the decrypted L7 request. The only place a DLP
                                        profile, an upload or a URL can be matched.
    - `action`            - What Gateway does with a match:
                              dns     : allow, block, override, safesearch, ytrestricted
                              network : allow, block, l4_override
                              http    : allow, block, off, on, scan, noscan, isolate,
                                        noisolate, quarantine, redirect
                            "off" is Do Not Inspect - the connection is passed through
                            undecrypted. It is how a Microsoft 365 bypass is written.
    - `precedence`        - Evaluation order within this policy's type. Lower runs
                            first and Gateway stops at the first allow or block it
                            matches, so this is the whole of the rule ordering.
                            Precedences below var.reserved_precedence_ceiling are
                            reserved for the platform baseline and refused here.
                            Leave gaps - steps of 100 - so a rule can be inserted
                            later without renumbering the ones after it.
    - `description`       - (Optional) Shown in the dashboard and the audit log.
    - `enabled`           - (Optional) Deploy the policy but leave it inactive.
    - `match_all_traffic` - (Optional) This policy deliberately names no selector and
                            matches everything of its type. Required for a catch-all,
                            and refused for allow, off, noscan and noisolate - Gateway
                            stops at the first match, so an unscoped allow deletes
                            every policy below it.

    MATCHING

    `match` names selectors; the layer compiles them into a Cloudflare wirefilter
    expression, so no config file contains one. The compiled shape is:

      ( destination terms OR'd ) and ( each remaining constraint AND'd )

    Destination terms - alternative ways of naming the same thing:

      domains               - the domain and all its subdomains. dns and http
      hosts                 - one exact hostname. dns and http
      sni_domains           - the same, read from the TLS SNI. network
      sni_hosts             - one exact SNI. network
      applications          - Cloudflare application NAMES, for example "Microsoft 365".
                              Resolved against the account's application catalogue at
                              plan time. One application covers every hostname
                              Cloudflare knows it uses
      content_categories    - Cloudflare content category NAMES
      security_categories   - Cloudflare security category NAMES, for example
                              "Command and Control & Botnet" and "Malware"
      destination_ip_cidrs  - destination ranges. On a dns policy this is the RESOLVED
                              address, so it is evaluated after the answer comes back

    Constraints - each is OR'd internally and AND'd against the rest:

      source_ip_cidrs       - where the request came from
      destination_ports     - network only
      protocols             - network only. "tcp", "udp" or "icmp"
      http_methods          - http only
      dlp_profile_ids       - http only. DLP profile UUIDs from the dashboard. A match
                              means the request body contained what the profile
                              describes
      upload_file_types     - http only. OR'd with download_file_types
      download_file_types   - http only

      negate                - invert the whole expression, for a default-deny rule
                              with an allowed list carved out

    `identity` restricts to people rather than traffic, and its terms are OR'd:
    `user_emails`, `user_group_names`, `user_group_emails`, `user_group_ids`.
    Group names are the ones the identity provider sends, which for Entra ID means
    the group's display name and needs `support_groups` on the provider in the
    zerotrust layer.

    `device_posture_check_ids` restricts to devices that PASSED the named WARP
    posture checks.

    `traffic_expression`, `identity_expression` and `device_posture_expression`
    take a raw wirefilter expression for a selector this layer does not model.
    They replace the compiled expression for that dimension rather than adding to
    it, and no guardrail can see inside one.

    SCHEDULING AND EXPIRY

    `schedule` restricts the policy to time windows, per day, in a named IANA time
    zone: `{ time_zone = "Europe/London", mon = "08:00-18:00" }`. A day left unset
    means the policy does not apply that day at all.

    `expiration` switches the policy off at a timestamp. Useful for a temporary
    exception, and a trap for anything else: nothing warns you the day it lapses.

    SETTINGS

    `settings` carries the parts of Cloudflare's rule_settings a gateway actually
    uses. Each is only accepted where Cloudflare honours it, and the plan says so
    if it is put somewhere else:

      block_reason                       - recorded and shown for a block
      block_page_enabled                 - Cloudflare's block page. dns block
      block_page                         - your own page instead. http block
      notification                       - the WARP client notification for a block
      redirect                           - required by action = "redirect"
      check_session                      - re-authentication interval. http, network
      l4_override                        - required by action = "l4_override"
      untrusted_cert_action              - what to do when the origin certificate does
                                           not validate. http
      payload_log_enabled                - store the matched content of a DLP hit.
                                           Governed by allow_dlp_payload_logging
      quarantine_file_types              - required by action = "quarantine"
      override_host / override_ips       - required by action = "override". dns
      insecure_disable_dnssec_validation - dns. Governed by

    DNS-over-HTTPS to a resolver that is not Gateway never asks the DNS policy.
    The HTTP policy sees the connection regardless.

    Selecting a baseline whose parameter list is empty fails the plan. That is
    not tidiness: an empty set renders as `in {}`, which Cloudflare rejects as a
    syntax error, and a bypass rule with no applications in it would be a Do Not
    Inspect policy matching nothing while the dashboard shows it as configured.

    Baseline policies occupy the precedence band below
    var.reserved_precedence_ceiling, so they evaluate before anything
    deployment/config/gateway.tfvars adds, and a policy there cannot get in

  description = <<-EOT
    Account-level Gateway configuration - the switches above the policy set,
    rather than a rule. Cloudflare stores one of these per account, so this is a
    singleton and the account already has one. Import it before the first
    apply that manages it - see "Account Settings & TLS Decryption" in
    deployment/README.md.

    null leaves the whole object unmanaged, and the Zero Trust dashboard stays
    authoritative for every field in it.

    The field that matters most is tls_decrypt.enabled. With it off, Gateway sees
    the TLS handshake and the SNI for an HTTPS request and nothing further, so
    every HTTP policy in gateway_policies is consulted for plaintext HTTP alone -
    while the dashboard lists them all as active. That is the state Cloudflare
    reports as "Your policies are active for HTTP traffic but not for HTTPS
    traffic".

    Turning it on has a prerequisite outside Terraform: every device on WARP has
    to trust the CA Gateway presents, or the user gets a certificate error on
    every site. Cloudflare's managed root is installed by the WARP client on a
    managed deployment; a BYOD fleet, an unmanaged device, or anything doing its
    own certificate pinning needs handling first. Roll it out to a pilot device
    group before the estate.

      - `tls_decrypt`             - inspect HTTPS. The switch above.
      - `inspection`              - "static" inspects the ports Cloudflare
                                    associates with HTTP/HTTPS, "dynamic" reads
                                    the first bytes and so also catches HTTPS on
                                    an unusual port.
      - `protocol_detection`      - identify a protocol from the initial bytes
                                    rather than from the port.
      - `certificate`             - UUID of the CA Gateway presents when it
                                    decrypts. Unset uses Cloudflare's managed
                                    certificate.
      - `body_scanning`           - "deep" or "shallow" DLP body inspection.
      - `antivirus`               - upload and download scanning, and what to do
                                    with a file that could not be scanned.
      - `sandbox`                 - detonate files before delivery.
      - `block_page`              - the account-wide block page.
      - `activity_log`            - write Gateway activity logs.
      - `browser_isolation`       - clientless isolation, non-identity onramps.
      - `extended_email_matching` - treat user+tag@ and dotted variants as one
                                    identity, so an email policy cannot be
                                    sidestepped with a full stop.
      - `fips`                    - FIPS 140-2 ciphers only.
      - `host_selector`           - hostname selection in egress policies.
      - `max_ttl_secs`            - cap on the TTL Gateway returns for a DNS
                                    answer.

    Anything omitted is left as it is in the dashboard rather than cleared, so
    this does not have to describe the whole object at once. Read the first plan
    after the import carefully all the same - it is the one that shows what
    Terraform believes the account currently looks like.
