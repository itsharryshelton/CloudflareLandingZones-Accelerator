# Platform Gateway baseline catalogue.
#
# The Secure Web Gateway rules any deployment is likely to want.
#
# Every entry carries the same attribute set, including the ones it does not use,
# because Terraform needs one type across the map.
#
# PRECEDENCE: unique across every entry here, DNS and HTTP alike. Cloudflare
# keeps all three builders in one rule collection, so a number reused between a
# DNS and an HTTP policy is rejected at apply with 409 "A rule with this
# precedence already exists" - and because Terraform creates them concurrently,
# whichever loses the race is arbitrary. Ordering within a type is what the
# relative values express; the gaps between them are deliberate headroom.
