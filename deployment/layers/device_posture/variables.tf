    Service provider integrations, keyed by a logical key: the connections
    Cloudflare polls for what a third-party MDM or EDR thinks of each device. A
    service provider rule reads through one by `integration_key`.

    The key is a handle. The `name` is identity: renaming it replaces the
    integration, and every rule reading through it with it.

    - `name`     - Display name in the dashboard.
    - `type`     - "intune", "crowdstrike_s2s", "kolide", "sentinelone_s2s",
                   "tanium_s2s", "workspace_one", "uptycs" or "custom_s2s".
    - `interval` - (Optional) How often Cloudflare polls, e.g. "10m" or "1h".
                   Falls back to var.default_integration_interval.
    - `config`   - The non-secret connection settings. What each type needs:
                     intune          - client_id (the app registration's
                                       Application ID), customer_id (the Entra
                                       tenant ID). The app registration needs
                                       Graph DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All.
                     crowdstrike_s2s - client_id, customer_id, api_url (the Falcon
                                       base URL). The API client needs Hosts:Read and
                                       Zero Trust Assessment:Read.
                     kolide          - nothing
                     sentinelone_s2s - api_url, e.g. https://<tenant>.sentinelone.net
                     tanium_s2s      - api_url, the Gateway GraphQL endpoint
                     workspace_one   - client_id, api_url, auth_url (the region's
                                       token URL)
                     uptycs          - customer_id
                     custom_s2s      - api_url, access_client_id (an Access service
                                       token protecting api_url)
                   There is NO secret field here on purpose - see
                   var.device_posture_integration_secrets.

    Cloudflare tests the connection when the integration is created, so a bad
    credential fails the apply, not the plan. Uptycs can be connected, but the
    provider has no Uptycs rule type, so nothing can evaluate it yet.

    plans again:

      TF_VAR_device_posture_integration_secrets={"intune":{"client_secret":"<secret>"}}

    A credential written into a .tfvars is committed the moment somebody runs
    `git add .`, and .gitignore will not save you: deployment/config/*.tfvars is
    explicitly un-ignored so the config can be committed.

    The value lands in this layer's local state file, and in any saved plan, in
    plain text, because Terraform records what it sent. Each credential reads
    device inventory out of an MDM or EDR, so scope it read-only at the provider,
    give it an expiry, and rotate it by changing the environment variable and
    re-applying.

    Device posture rules, keyed by a logical key - the checks an Access policy

                          Types in var.restricted_posture_rule_types are refused.
    - `description`     - (Optional) Shown in the dashboard.
    - `schedule`        - (Optional) Client re-check interval, e.g. "5m". Falls back
                          to var.default_posture_schedule. Minimum 1m.
    - `expiration`      - (Optional) How long a result stays valid. Falls back to
                          twice the polling period while var.derive_posture_expiration
                          is on. Shorter than twice the polling period fails the
                          plan: the result would lapse before it is refreshed, and
                          devices would fail intermittently.
    - `platforms`       - (Optional) windows, mac, linux, android, ios, chromeos.
                          Empty runs everywhere.
    - `integration_key` - Service provider checks: a key from
                          var.device_posture_integrations, of the same type.
    - `integration_id`  - The same, for an integration managed elsewhere. Exactly
                          one of the two.
    - `input`           - What the check compares against. The fields per type are
                          listed on the `rules` variable in modules/device_posture.
                          The common ones:
                            os_version       - operating_system, operator, version
                                               (full semver: "10.0.19045")

                            crowdstrike_s2s  - overall, operator, e.g. ">=" and "70"

    Removing a rule an Access or Gateway policy still names leaves that policy
    requiring a check nothing can pass - and this layer applies before zerotrust,
    so removing both in one run deletes the rule first. Remove the reference,
    apply, then remove the rule.
