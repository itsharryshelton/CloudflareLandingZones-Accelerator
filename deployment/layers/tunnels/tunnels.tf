# Cloudflare Tunnel: outbound-only connectors that publish private origins on
# public hostnames, and the private network routes WARP clients reach through
# them.
#
# I kept apart from the zerotrust layer on purpose. Access decides who may reach an
# application; a tunnel decides what is reachable at all. Separate state means
# an Access policy change cannot delete a tunnel, and a tunnel change cannot
# loosen a policy.
#
# One module instance for the account. Its ID comes from config/account.tfvars.
#
# Modules are sourced by relative path from this repository's modules/
# directory, so a clone is self-contained and there is no tag to pin.
