    Cloudflare Tunnels, keyed by a logical key. Routes refer to a tunnel by that
    key.

    The key is a handle. The `name` is identity: changing it destroys and
    recreates the tunnel, which issues a new tunnel ID and token and disconnects
    every connector running the old one.

    - `name`              - Display name in the dashboard. Unique on the account.
    - `config_src`        - (Optional) "cloudflare" - remotely managed, and the
                            ingress rules below are pushed to every connector - or
                            "local", where the connector reads config.yml on its
                            own host and `ingress` must be empty. Falls back to
                            var.default_tunnel_config_src. Changing it replaces the
                            tunnel.
    - `ingress`           - (Optional) Public hostnames, IN EVALUATION ORDER. The
                            first rule that matches a request decides, so a
                            path-specific rule must come before the bare hostname
                            it narrows. Each rule is:
                              `hostname`       - the public hostname, for example
                                                 "grafana.example.com". A leading
                                                 "*." publishes every subdomain.
                              `zone_key`       - a key from zones.tfvars. The layer
                                                 creates the proxied CNAME pointing
                                                 the hostname at the tunnel, in that
                                                 zone. Leave it out only for a

                                                 dns.tfvars: Cloudflare refuses a
                                                 second record of the same name.
                              `path`           - (Optional) A regular expression the
                                                 request path must match.
                              `service`        - Where cloudflared sends the request:
                                                 http://, https://, tcp://, ssh://,

                            A catch-all rule answering `catch_all_service` is
                            appended after the last rule. Do not write one.
    - `catch_all_service` - (Optional) What a request matching no rule gets. Falls
                            back to var.default_catch_all_service.
    - `origin_request`    - (Optional) Tunnel-wide settings for the connection
                            between cloudflared and the origin:
                              `access`             - { team_name, aud_tags, required }.
                                                     cloudflared validates the Access

                                                     without passing Access is refused.
                                                     `aud_tags` are Access application
                                                     AUD tags - the zerotrust layer's
                                                     access_applications output.
                                                     `required` defaults to true.

                                                     Timeouts are in seconds.

    A public hostname is reachable by anybody on the internet unless an Access
    application in the zerotrust layer covers it. This layer cannot see that
    layer's state, so it cannot check. Pair every hostname here with an
    application there, and set `access` so the origin enforces it too.

    Redundancy is more connectors on one tunnel, not more tunnels: run cloudflared
    with the same token on two hosts and Cloudflare balances across them.
