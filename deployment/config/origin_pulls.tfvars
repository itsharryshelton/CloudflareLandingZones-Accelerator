#
# Authenticated Origin Pulls is mutual TLS between the Cloudflare edge and the
# origin: the edge presents a client certificate, and an origin configured to
# verify it stops accepting anything that did not come through Cloudflare.
#
# ORDER MATTERS. Applying this changes what Cloudflare SENDS; it does not make
# the origin ask for anything. Apply here first, take the bundle out of the
# layer's origin_trust_bundles output, install it at the origin, and only then
# switch the origin to require a client certificate. The reverse order fails
# every request in between.
#
# Requires the zone's SSL mode to be full or strict, which is the zones layer's
# default. On flexible there is no origin TLS connection to authenticate.
#
# NO CERTIFICATE OR PRIVATE KEY GOES IN THIS FILE. Certificate material is set
# as the TF_VAR_origin_pull_certificates environment variable, and referenced
# here by key only.

  # Zone-wide, on the certificate Cloudflare presents by default.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A dedicated certificate, zone-wide and per hostname

# Commented out because it needs certificate material in the environment, and a
# reference to a key that is not there fails the plan by design.
#
# To use it, generate a client certificate (self-signed is normal here - the
# origin trusts the certificate itself, not a public CA), then set
# TF_VAR_origin_pull_certificates in the shell that runs cflz. Its value is one
# JSON object, with the PEM line breaks kept intact:
#
#   export TF_VAR_origin_pull_certificates="$(jq -n \
#     --rawfile cert api.crt --rawfile key api.key \
#     '{api_origin: {certificate: $cert, private_key: $key}}')"
