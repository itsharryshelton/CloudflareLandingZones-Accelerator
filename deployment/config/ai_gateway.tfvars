# Gateways are account-scoped, not zone-scoped: nothing here has to match a key in
# zones.tfvars. An application uses a gateway only once its base URL is changed to
# the one in the ai_gateway_endpoints output - this file cannot do that part.
#
# The keys are state addresses; gateway_id is what clients call. Renaming a key
# without a `moved` block deletes and recreates the gateway, and its logs with it.
