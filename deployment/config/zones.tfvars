# Zones.
#
# Identity only: logical key => domain name. Passed to EVERY layer. So you only need to reference "primary" instead of your domain.
# Keys are permanent. Renaming one destroys and recreates the zone in the zones. Don't change unless you fancy remaking it fully.
#
# Zone configuration (settings, DNS records) lives in dns.tfvars, not here - the waf and load_balancing layers do not require seeing DNS records.
