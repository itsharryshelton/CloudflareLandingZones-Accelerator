# Widgets are account-scoped, not zone-scoped. Nothing here has to match a key in
# zones.tfvars, and the layer never reads that file - Cloudflare treats the hostname
# list as free text, so a typo produces a widget that silently refuses to render
# rather than an error at apply.
#
# A hostname covers its own subdomains, so the apex entries below already serve www.
#
# The keys are state addresses. Renaming one destroys and recreates the widget,
# which issues a new sitekey and breaks every page still carrying the old one.

turnstile_widgets = {
  # One widget per set of hostnames that may share a secret: whoever holds the
  # secret can validate a token for every hostname the widget lists. A staging
  # site therefore belongs on its own widget - but only if it sits on its own
  # apex, because listing "example.com" here already covers "staging.example.com".
