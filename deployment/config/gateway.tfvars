# Cloudflare Gateway (Secure Web Gateway).
#
# A baseline meant to be dropped onto a new account and then edited.
#
# Three enforcement pipelines: dns, network and http each have their own precedence sequence
# Gateway stops at the first allow or block it matches within one.
#
# Precedence below 100 is reserved for the platform baseline in
# layers/gateway/locals.gateway.tf. The bands used below are:
#
#   dns      100-199   resolver-level blocks
#   network  100-199   L4 blocks, each allow immediately above the block it exempts
#   http     100-199   inspection decisions and SaaS tenant control
#            200-299   content and payload blocks
#            300-399   isolation
#            400+      acceptable use
#
# NAMES ARE RESOLVED AT PLAN TIME. Every category and application below is named
# rather than numbered, and the layer resolves it against this account's own
# Cloudflare catalogue. A name Cloudflare does not publish fails the plan and
# prints the list of valid names, so a rename on Cloudflare's side is a
# failed plan rather than a rule that quietly matches nothing. Expect to correct
# one or two of these on first apply.
#
# EDIT before this is a real baseline:
#   - gateway_dlp_profile_ids            the UUIDs from this account's DLP profiles
#   - allow_sanctioned_smtp_relay        the relay address
#   - allow_sanctioned_admin_endpoints   the bastion ranges
#   - restrict_microsoft_365_tenants     the tenant, then enable
#   - restrict_google_workspace_tenants  the domain, then enable
#   - allow_sanctioned_software_sources  the download mirrors this estate uses
