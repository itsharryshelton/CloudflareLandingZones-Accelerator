# cf-api-throttle.py - a loopback rate limiter in front of the Cloudflare API.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Cloudflare allows 1200 API requests per five minutes per credential. The
# zones layer holds one cloudflare_zone, one cloudflare_zone_rules and roughly
# seven cloudflare_zone_setting resources per zone, and every one of them is a
# GET on every refresh. At a few hundred zones that is thousands of reads in a
# single plan, and Terraform issues them as fast as its scheduler allows.
#
# The Cloudflare Terraform provider was able to pace itself in 4.x - `rps`,
# `retries`, `min_backoff` and `max_backoff` were provider arguments. The 5.x
# rewrite dropped all four and never replaced them, so a 5.x provider has no
# rate limiting and no 429 retry at all:
#   https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/5505
# The run fails partway through with
#   429 {"code":971,"message":"Please wait and consider throttling your request speed"}
# surfaced as "failed to make http request" against whichever resource happened
# to be in flight.
#
# `-parallelism` alone does not fix this. It caps how many resources Terraform
# works on at once, not the request rate: even at -parallelism=1 a sequence of
# fast reads sustains well over four per second, which is the ceiling 1200/5min
# works out to.
#
# So the pacing is done here instead. The provider's base URL is pointed at this
# process, every request waits for a token from a shared bucket, and a 429 that
# still gets through is retried here with the API's own Retry-After rather than
# failing the resource. Terraform sees a slow API, not a rate-limited one, and
# the run takes as long as the rate limit says it must.
#
# CREDENTIAL HANDLING - read before changing anything below
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Every proxied request carries the Cloudflare credential in its headers - the
# Global API Key and its email, or a bearer token - so this process handles a
# live credential:
#
#   * The listener binds to 127.0.0.1 only. Nothing off the host can reach it,
#     which is also why plaintext HTTP on the inbound hop is acceptable - it
#     never leaves the loopback interface. The outbound hop to Cloudflare is
#     always HTTPS.
#   * Request and response headers and bodies are NEVER logged. The log carries
#     method, path, status and timing, nothing else. Do not add header or body
#     logging for debugging; a saved terminal log outlives the day the key is
#     rotated.
#   * Nothing is written to disk. No cache, no request log, no state file.
#   * The upstream host is fixed by --upstream and defaults to the real API, so
#     a poisoned environment variable cannot redirect credentialed traffic to an
#     arbitrary host.
#
# USAGE
# Optional. A baseline of policies and applications never comes near the limit;
# this is for a layer with hundreds of resources, such as a large DNS import.
# Start it in one terminal:
#   python3 scripts/cf-api-throttle.py --rps 3.5 --port 8787
# and point Terraform at it in the terminal that runs cflz:
#   export CLOUDFLARE_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8787/client/v4"       # bash
#   $env:CLOUDFLARE_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8787/client/v4"       # PowerShell
#
# Terminating it with SIGTERM or SIGINT prints a summary of what it absorbed.
