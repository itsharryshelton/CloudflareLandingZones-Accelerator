# d1-migrations.sh [layer_dir]
#
# Applies the committed SQL migrations to the D1 databases the workers layer has
# just created. Run it after `cflz apply workers`.
#
#   $ scripts/d1-migrations.sh              # deployment/layers/workers
#   $ DRY_RUN=1 scripts/d1-migrations.sh    # list what would be applied
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT TERRAFORM
# -------------------------
# A migration is an ordered, one-way change to data. Terraform reconciles a
# desired state: it has no concept of "0003 ran, 0004 has not", it cannot apply
# two files in order, and a resource removed from configuration is a resource it
# proposes to destroy. Modelling `CREATE TABLE` as a Terraform resource gets you
# a plan that offers to drop a table because somebody deleted a file.
#
# So the layer owns the database and the binding, and the schema is applied here,
# against the database_id the layer outputs. wrangler keeps a `d1_migrations`
# table inside each database recording which files it has run, which is what
# makes a re-run of this script a no-op rather than a second application.
#
# WHERE THE FILES LIVE
# --------------------
#   deployment/layers/workers/migrations/<database_key>/0001_initial_schema.sql
#
# <database_key> is the logical key from `d1_databases` in workers.tfvars - the
# same key a binding uses - so nothing here needs a database name or a UUID, and
# adding a migration is a file rather than an edit to this script.
#
# Migrations sit in the layer rather than in deployment/config/ for the same
# reason Worker source does: it is code, not configuration. A database key that
# workers.tfvars declares gets its migrations. A directory here that matches no
# declared key fails the run, so delete the example's when you drop its database.
#
# THE FILE NAMES ARE THE ORDER
# ----------------------------
# wrangler sorts by the number at the front of the name and records the file name
# it applied, so:
#   * A name is permanent. Renaming an applied migration makes wrangler apply it
#     again under its new name, against a database that already has the change.
#   * Editing an applied migration does nothing at all - the name is already in
#     d1_migrations - and leaves the file describing a schema that was never
#     created. Add a migration instead.
#
# WHAT IT DOES TO THE DATABASE
# ----------------------------
# Everything is validated before anything is applied, and each database is
# applied separately so a failure on one does not leave a second half-migrated.
# D1 has no snapshots to roll back to, which is why the destructive-statement
# warning below is worth reading rather than skipping.
#
# Reads from the environment:
#   CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY and CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL, or CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
#                           the credential the Terraform run used. wrangler
#                           reads the same variables. Required.
#   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID   the account the databases live in. Defaults to
#                           cloudflare_account_id in
#                           deployment/config/account.tfvars.
#   CLOUDFLARE_API_BASE_URL wrangler's API root. Point it at cf-api-throttle.py
#                           to pace these calls; unset, wrangler goes straight
#                           to Cloudflare.
#   DRY_RUN                 1 = list what would be applied and apply nothing.
#   MIGRATIONS_DIR          directory inside the layer holding the per-database
#                           directories. Defaults to "migrations".
